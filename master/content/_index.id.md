The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) released a statement late on Friday breaking down the timeline of the attack on a medical convoy in Gaza City that killed at least 15 people.

Here’s the full statement:

“Around 4:05pm local time [14:05 GMT], a convoy of ambulances left Al-Shifa Hospital in a decision that was coordinated with the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.

The convoy, which was headed towards the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, included five ambulance vehicles: four belonged to the Health Ministry and one belonged to PRCS.

The convoy travelled about four kilometres from the hospital to the al-Rashid coastal road but found it was impassible due to rocks and a large amount of shelling in the area.

The vehicles returned towards the Al-Shifa Hospital; When they were about one kilometre from the facility, the first ambulance at the head of the convoy – which belonged to the Health Ministry – was directly hit.

The other vehicles continued towards the hospital. As soon as the first ambulance reached the gate of Al-Shifa Hospital, the front of the vehicle was hit. This attack killed 15 people and injured dozens.”


Surabaya - Ketua DPP PDIP Puan Maharani menegaskan Gibran Rakabuming masih menjadi bagian dari partainya. Meski anak Presiden Jokowi tersebut telah menerima pencalonan jadi cawapres dari Golkar.
"Kan belum keluar. Ya lihat nanti orang belum keluar," kata Puan usai menghadiri acara silaturahmi bersama gus dan ning di Grand City, Surabaya, Sabtu (21/10/2023).

Ditanya apakah akan menjatuhkan sanksi terhadap Gibran jika akhirnya menerima jadi cawapres Prabowo. Lagi-lagi Puan menegaskan bahwa Gibran belum membuat keputusan apapun.
