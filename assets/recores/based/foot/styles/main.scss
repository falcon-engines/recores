/* Base Styles
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– */
/* NOTE
html is set to 62.5% so that all the REM measurements throughout Skeleton
are based on 10px sizing. So basically 1.5rem = 15px :) */

/* media queries
    Note: The best way to structure the use of media queries is to create the queries
    near the relevant code. For example, if you wanted to change the styles for buttons
    on small devices, paste the mobile query code up in the buttons section and style it
    there.

    1. media-xs   : 420px;
    2. media-sm   : 768px;
    3. media-md   : 992px;
    4. media-lg   : 1200px;
    5. media-xl   : 1400px;
    1. media-gx   : 1956px;
